# Airline-Passengers-Satisfaction


This project analyzes which factors are associated with airline passenger satisfaction using a Kaggle dataset with survey responses and satisfaction labels. My interest in this project lies in the question: *Can EDA "predict" the satisfaction as good as ML models?*

## Project structure


```text
data/
  raw/           - original Kaggle files (not tracked in git)
  processed/     - cleaned data created by the notebooks

notebooks/
  eda.ipynb   - data cleaning and exploratory analysis

reports/
  figures/       - exported plots

  (optional) helper functions for cleaning and modeling
```

## Exploratory Analysis

In this part I explore the dataset in order to understand what influences the overal passengers satisfaction.

## Data Modeling

In this part I use several classification algorithms to predict the passengers satisfaction:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest 

## Requirements

## Data Source
I took the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)

## License

The repo is under MIT Lisence
